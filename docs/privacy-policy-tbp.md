# App Alkitab Tejemahan Plembang Privacy Policy

This App Privacy Policy is to help you understand what, if any, data we collect as a result of you using our apps and what we do with that data.


## WHAT ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE DOES THE APP NEED?
Our apps need access to read/write to your deviceâ€™s storage (memory) space, including memory cards, e.g., SD card. This allows for a download of the audio to be stored on the local device and played while the app is running. The user has the option to give permissions for this to happen or not.

## WHAT INFORMATION MIGHT WE COLLECT?
Our app may or may not collect the following type of non-personally identifiable information:
* Type of device (e.g. Samsung S3).
* Version of operating system (e.g. Android 6.0).
* City/Country where connected to internet (e.g. Nagpur, India).
* What was read/accessed from within the app.

If analytics for the app is enabled and the device is connected to the internet, the app will connect from time to time to send usage information to the app developer. If the app does not connect to the internet, the analytic data is not collected.

Our apps do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). PII is any information regarding a natural person, a legal person, an institution or an association, which is, or can be, identified, even indirectly, by reference to any other information, including a personal identification number.


## WHAT DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR?

Any of the information we collect from you may be used primarily to gauge how many people use the app and where they are using it. Secondarily, it may be used to improve our application to better support our users, wherever in the world they are located.

## HOW DO WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
